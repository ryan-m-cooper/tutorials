### How to download parcel boundaries from a qPublic site

#### Target Audience:
citizens, realtors, lawyers

#### Objectives:

* Search for and find a specific property on a qPublic site
* Download a property's parcel boundary from a qPublic site

#### Introduction:

In Kentucky, property tax assessment is handled at the county level by, for the most part, the Property Valuation Administrator (PVA). A given county's PVA data often times contains a lot of useful information about a property's address, value, types of structures and more. Accessing this data varies from county to county. Many Kentucky counties allow some level of access to PVA data through a qPublic site. qPublic sites potentially allow users to have access to a county's PVA data although this access is often contingent on one's ability to pay for a pricey subscription. That said, counties like Fayette and Scott have largely made there PVA data available for free. This includes parcel boundaries. 

The purpose of this little tutorial is to walk you through how to search for and download a KML version of a property's parcel boundary through one of the more openly accessible qPublic sites. At the end of the tutorial you should have a file that you can view in Google Earth or work with in more advanced mapping programs like QGIS, ArcGIS, or CartoDB.
