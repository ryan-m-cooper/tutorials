#### WELCOME!

In my time as a teaching assistant at UK, an organizer of maptimeLEX, and GIS Technician at the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission I've found myself in creating little lessons and tutorials on mapping and data for various people and groups. This site is meant to be a central repository of those tutorials. Certainly this is not a comprhensive source of tutorials, but I hope that if you're here, you find something that will help you get on the right track with your project.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at ryancooper729 _at_ gmail _dot_ com.
